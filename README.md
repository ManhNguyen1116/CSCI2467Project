# CSCI2467Project: Cache Management System

* In this project, a cache management system will be created using Java. AWS caching integration can be used.
* An app will be made that lets the user fill out a field that searches for several images. The search also includes metadata for every item. 
* A cache management system will be integrated into this app so that the information needed by the user is automatically given upon request.

* The app will be put on the web using HTML, CSS, and Javascript
